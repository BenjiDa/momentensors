# Plotting moment tensors in qgis

Visualizations of earthquake data for GIS. Scripts here for importing data from libcomcat and creating .svg files for plotting in QGIS. Inspired by post by http://rocksandwater.net/blog/2017/09/plot-focal-mechs-in-qgis/ but tailored to fit my needs. 

eq_import_svg_export.py will download earthquake data and create folder of svg format focal mechanisms. 

fm_plotting.py is meant to be run in the QGIS python window and will plot up focal mechanisms.
